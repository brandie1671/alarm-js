The purpose of this project is to create an innovative alarm clock with motion-snooze functionality. The alarm clock starts with a countdown of 2 minutes. When the countdown reaches zero, the alarm is triggered, alerting the user. However, the alarm can be snoozed by simply moving in front of a motion sensor. When snoozed, the countdown is reset to 2 minutes without sounding the alarm. The alarm clock allows multiple snoozes, and each snooze increments the snooze count, providing a user-friendly wake-up experience.
